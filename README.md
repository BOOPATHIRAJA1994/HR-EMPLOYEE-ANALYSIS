# üõçÔ∏è Mini Project:  HR-EMPLOYEE-ANALYSIS

---

## üìò Project Overview
This project focuses on the **HR EMPLOYEE ANALYSIS** using **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI**.  
The main objective is to **transform, model, and visualize** the raw data to derive **actionable business insigh**, identify **Employees work status**, and measure **performance of employees**.

---

## üìÇ Source Datasets
The analysis is based on **four core datasets**:

| File Name | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| `employee_data.csv.` | Contains Employee details |
| `employee_engagement_survey_data.csv` | Includes Employees engagement score,satisfaction score |
| `recruitment_data.csv` | includes applicants full details |
| `training_and_development_data.csv` | Provides training data,training abserving level and training outcome details  |
---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel** ‚Äì Data preparation and initial exploration  
- **Power BI** ‚Äì Data transformation, modeling, and interactive dashboard creation  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** ‚Äì For calculated columns and business measures  

---

## üîÑ Phase 1 ‚Äì Data Transformation & Data Modeling

### **Data Import & Cleaning**
1. Imported all three CSV files into Power BI.  
2. Limited the *employee_data.csv* table to the **first 3000 rows** for optimized analysis.  
3. Changed data types appropriately:  
   - *first name,last name ‚Üí full name*  
   - *dd-mm-yyyy ‚Üí yyyy-mm-dd*  
4. Formatted *Employee id & Termination Description* into **Proper Case** for consistency.  
5.Limited the *recruitment_data.csv* table to Merged *City* and *State* columns to create a new **Country** column in the format `City, State`.  
6. Added a **AGE(YEARS)** column using the formula:  
AGE(YEARS) ==DATEDIF(E2,TODAY(),"Y")

7. Added a **Year of Work** column using the formula:  
Year of Work = DATEDIF(C2, D2, "Y") & " Years, " & DATEDIF(C2, D2, "YM") & " Months"
8. Merged *employee_engagement_survey_data.csvr* and *employee_data.csv.* into a unified table **EMPLOYEE ID** using *EMPLOYEE ID*.  
9. Identified and handled **missing values** and **duplicate rows**.  
10. **Grouped & Aggregated Metrics**:
 - Average SATISFIED WORK EMPLOYEE by Category   

### **Relationships Established**
- *employee_engagement_survey_data.csv* ‚Üî *employee_data.csv* ‚Üî *raining_and_development_data.csv* ‚Üí via **EMPLOYEE ID**

### **Calculated Measures**
| Measure | Formula / Description |
|----------|----------------------|
| **total employees** | `COUNTROWS(employee_data))` |
| **total applicants** | `COUNT(recruitment_data[Applicant ID])` |
| **male** | `CALCULATE([total employees],employee_data[Gender]="male")")` |
| **female** | `CALCULATE([total employees],employee_data[Gender]="female")` |
